# Lipschitz Bounded Networks

This repository containts a collection of Lipschitz bounded networks to use for our research at the ACFR. All networks are implemented in Python/JAX.

The intention is to have a common library of network implementations so that we can avoid repeated code. This way, we can all contribute to making the networks more efficient and sufficiently modular for use in all of our research projects.

This repository is a work-in-progress.
